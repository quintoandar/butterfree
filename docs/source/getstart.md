# Getting Started

Butterfree depends on **Python 3.7+** and it is **Spark 3.0 ready**.

[Python Package Index](https://quintoandar.github.io/python-package-server/) hosts reference to a pip-installable module of this library, using it is as straightforward as including it on your project's requirements.

```bash
pip install butterfree
```

Or after listing `butterfree` in your `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
