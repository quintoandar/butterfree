# Contributing to Butterfree

:tada: :clap:  First of all, thank you for wanting to contribute and be part of this project! :clap: :tada:

This document describes our guidelines for contributing to Butterfree and it's modules. The content will help with guides so that you can contribute more easily and so that our code maintains a high standard of quality. Probably not all possible cases will be covered in this document, so we hope you to use your best judgment, and feel free to help us enhance this document in a pull request.

## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

TBD

#### Type Hint

We use type hint in all of our methods arguments and in the return of the methods too. This way, our methods will have a very explicit declaration of is expected as inputs and outputs, making easier for anyone to understand. Besides that, using type hints will help us with documentation. More information can be found in Python [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

Example:
```Python
def read(self, format: str, options: dict, stream: bool = False) -> DataFrame:
```

### Documentation Styleguide

#### Use [Google Style Documentation](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).

From the common Python documentation styles that follow [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) guides, we found Google's one the most human readable. Besides that, is totaly compatible with Sphinx with [Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) plugin.

You can easily configure PyCharm to use this style in "Python Integrated Tools":

There is **no need to write about the types** of arguments or returns of a method since we decide to use type hints instead. Using [this](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/) plugin metadata about types in documentation can be easily generated by Sphinx.

Example of class documentation:
```Python
class CassandraConfig(AbstractWriteConfig):
    """Configuration for Spark to connect on Cassandra DB.

    References can be found
    [here](https://docs.databricks.com/data/data-sources/cassandra.html).

    Attributes:
        mode: write mode for Spark.
        format_: write format for Spark.
        keyspace:  Cassandra DB keyspace to write data.
        username: username to use in connection.
        password: password to use in connection.
        host: host to use in connection.
    """
```
