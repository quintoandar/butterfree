    """Defines a TimestampFeature.

    A FeatureSet must contain one TimestampFeature, which will be used as a time
    tag for the state of all features. By containing a timestamp feature, users
    may time travel over their features. The Feature Set may validate that the
    set of keys and timestamp are unique for a feature set.

    By defining a TimestampColumn, the feature set will always contain a data
    column called "timestamp" of TimestampType (spark dtype).

    Attributes:
        from_column: original column to build a "timestamp" feature column.
            Used when there is transformation or the transformation has no
            reference about the column to use for.
            If from_column is None, the FeatureSet will assume the input
            dataframe already has a data column called "timestamp".
        transformation: transformation that will be applied to create the
            "timestamp". Type casting will already happen when no transformation
            is given. But a timestamp can be derived from multiple columns, like
            year, month and day, for example. The transformation must always
            handle naming and typing.
